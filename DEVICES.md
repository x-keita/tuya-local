### SmartPlugs/Wall sockets/Wall switches

Most smartplugs follow a fairly standard template from Tuya, so many
will work with other brands configs.  However there are many
permutations of features enabled, and some manufacturers move
datapoints around so smartplugs take up a lot more configurations than
such simple devices should.  A future release will look at
consolidating these into a smaller number of configs.  When you add a device,
the default selected option for the device type has the most matching
datapoints, so provided it looks like the same  type of device, it is probably
the best option.
